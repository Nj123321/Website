	<section id="description">
		<p> I created a pipeline and model for a housing prices with a dataset of Cook County, Illinois.<br>
            The <a href="https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Property-Taxation/Assessor-Archived-05-11-2022-Residential-Sales-Dat/5pge-nu6u/about_data">dataset</a> consists of 500,000+ observations and 62 features.

        <h1>The Data Pipleline</h1>
        <p id="commands"> For each feature below, I cleaned the data by removing invalid data points as well as not including any outliers in the analysis and performing any transformation operations if needed. I first worked on the response variable, Sales Price. <u>Click on image below to see the cleaned Sales Price distribution with a log transformation.</u> 
        </p>
        <img class="curr_score_graph" id="priceGraph" src="../images/Projects/housing/pricebefore.png" onclick="changePrice()">
        <p> To include include the roof material into our predictor variables, I one hot encoded each of the different materials below, turning each into seperate indicator variables I added to each column.
            <u>Click below on each box plot to see the distribution of their respective indicator variables.</u>
        </p>
        <img class="curr_score_graph" src="../images/Projects/housing/materialPlot.png" alt="err" usemap="#materialMap" id="materialPlot">
        <p> From the description of each housing listing, I also used regex to extract the number of bedrooms in each house, below is a violin plot showing the relationship between number of bedrooms and sale price
        </p>
        <img class="curr_score_graph " src="../images/Projects/housing/bedroomsPlot.png" alt>
        <p> Also, I grouped houses that shared neighborhoods and found the top 3 most expensive neighborhoods using pandas, and created an indicator variable for it called "in_expensive_neighborhood".
        </p>
        <img class="curr_score_graph " src="../images/Projects/housing/expensivePlot.png" alt>
        <p> I then also took a look at the correlation between the area of each house and the sale price through a joint plot.

        <h1>The Model</h1>
        <p> After running the data through the pipline functions above, I then split the data into training and testing data, 204792 used for the training set and 68264 used for the test set. <br>
            I constructed a linear classifier with scikit learn using existing features and the newly generated ones, with a Residual plot below.
