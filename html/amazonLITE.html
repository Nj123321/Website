        <h1><u>Specs</u></h1>
        <h2>Internet(External) Access</h2>
        <p> External applications can access the application using a RESTful API, which routing is determined by the API Gateway
        </p>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p> The API Gateway is secured with oauth2.0 where jwt token generation is handled by Keycloak using private credentials.
            The discovery server also uses in-memory security where passwords are stored as byte-encodings to authenticate users who view the browser interface.
        </p>
        <h2>Microservice Communication</h2>
        <p> Each microservice and the API gateway is connected to a discovery service through http using spring Spring Web. Load balancing between duplicate microservices is done with round robin. Circuit breakers were also
            implemented between microservices. Kraft (Kafka without zookeeper) was also used to support 
            email notifications whenever an order was placed.
        </p>
        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p> Each microservice connected to locally hosted databases using spring data jpa, for mysql and mongodb databases.
        </p>

        <h2>Maintence</h2>
        <p> Implemented integration testing using Docker Images, logging, and distributed tracing for easier debugging.
